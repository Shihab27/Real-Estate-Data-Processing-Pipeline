# Real-Estate-Data-Processing-Pipeline
## Project Overview
This capstone project involves developing a comprehensive real estate data processing pipeline using Python. It covers end-to-end data analysis tasks including data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis, culminating in actionable insights into real estate market dynamics.
## Project Objective
The primary goal is to equip students with practical skills in data management by handling a real-world real estate dataset. Students will:
- Ingest real estate data into a Python environment.
- Clean and preprocess data to handle missing values, outliers, invalid entries, and inconsistencies.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, identify key trends, and derive insights.
- Visualize data to uncover patterns, relationships, and market dynamics.
## Dataset Attributes
The dataset used for this project includes the following key variables:
- **Marketing Spend:** Cost related to property marketing activities.
- **Operational Cost:** Operational expenses incurred.
- **Revenue, Expenses, Profit, Debt, Assets, Liabilities** for financial analysis.
- **Property details:** Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, property size (sqft), year built, lot size, etc.
- **Listing details:** Date added, sold status, days on market.
- **Agent and transaction information.**

## Project Tasks:
### 1. Data Ingestion
- Load the dataset from CSV into a structured Pandas DataFrame.
### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values using median for numeric columns and mode or appropriate methods for categorical data.
- Identify and handle outliers through the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- Validate data consistency (e.g., Profit calculation).
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Compute and interpret descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
- Generate **visualizations:**
  - **Line charts** showing revenue and expenses trends over time.
  - **Box plots** to detect spread and outliers in profit and cash flow.
  - **Pie/bar charts** displaying expense categories proportions.
### 4. Correlation and Statistical Analysis:
- Calculate correlations among key financial metrics.
- Perform hypothesis testing to assess:
  - If the average monthly profit significantly exceeds a benchmark value.
  - Whether there's a significant difference between revenue and expenses.
### 4. Financial Ratios & Insights:
- Calculate critical financial ratios:
  - Profit Margin (Profit/Revenue).
  - Debt-to-Asset Ratio (Debt/Assets).
  - Current Ratio (Assets/Liabilities).
- Compare calculated ratios against industry benchmarks to identify financial strengths or risks.
### 5. Trend Analysis:
- Perform a year-over-year analysis of revenue and profit growth rates.
- Identify periods with significant financial performance changes.
## Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scipy (statistical testing)
</br></br>This project serves as a practical application for students learning to perform complete data analysis workflows in Python, from data preprocessing to drawing actionable business insights.
